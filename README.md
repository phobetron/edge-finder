# Edge Finder

This is a simple jQuery module that takes a given image and scans it for edges, returning an array of pixels. It currently works best with flat monochrome graphics.

The module currently supports the following "directions" from which to scan:
* top
* right
* bottom
* left
* vertical (top and bottom)
* horizontal (left and right)
* entire (top, right, bottom, left)

This has not yet been tested with more complex images.
